  </header>
  <p>
    <span class="label">About CistromeMap</span>
    <span class="value">CistromeMap is a comprehensive knowledgebase of all of the publicly available ChIP-Seq and DNase-Seq data in mouse and human. We have also manually curated metadata to ensure annotation consistency, and developed a user-friendly display matrix for quick navigation and retrieval of data for specific factors, cells, and papers.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="label">How to use CistromeMap: Overview</span>
    <span class="value">There are three main tabs on the CistromeMap homepage: Factors View, Cells View, and Papers View.<br/><br/>
    </span>
    <span class="value">In the Factors View you can select a factor or factors of interest and can retrieve information from about samples associated with those factors.  The information may include the publication which the sample is associated and the cell line, species, cell type, etc. of the sample.  In most cases when there is data associated with the sample, a link will be provided so that you may download the data.<br/><br/>
    </span>
    <span class="value">The Cells View is similar to the Factors View, however,
in this view you would be selecting for the cell line, cell type, cell population, or tissue type of interest.  While in the Factors View, you may select multiple factors of interest, in the Cells View, you may only select one cell item at a time.<br/><br/>
    </span>
    <span class="value">The Papers View lets you browse all of the papers in our collection.  Clicking on a paper in this view will provide you with detailed information about the paper which includes the title, the list of authors, the abstract, a link to the NCBI records (if available), and the associated samples
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="label">How to use CistromeMap: Factors and Cells View</span>
    <span class="value">
      <ol>
	<li>Select the factors or cell of interest.  <br/>Note: In the factors view, to select multiple factors, hold the control-key while you click.</li>
	<li>Click "Draw Table"<br/>A table showing a matrix of factors and cells will be created. <br/>The values in each cell of the table represents the number of samples which correspond to the factor-cell.</li>
	<li>Click on a table-cell to get more information about the samples</li>
      </ol>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="label">How to use CistromeMap: Papers View</span>
    <span class="value">The papers view allows you to browse through the publications in our database.  Clicking on any of the publications will give you more detailed information about the paper.<br/><br/>
    </span>
    <span class="value">By default the papers are sorted by the Date column.  The Date represents when the paper was added to our collection.  The other columns in the Paper View are: Authors, Title, and Journal.  By clicking on any of the columns, you can sort the papers according to that category--e.g. if you click on "Title" at the top of the table, the table will be re-sorted by paper titles (in ascending order).  You can toggle between ascending and descending order by clicking on the column multiple times, so for example, if you were to click on "Title" again, the table will be resorted in descending title order.<br/><br/>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="label">How to use CistromeMap: Search</span>
    <span class="value">
      CistromeMap has a built-in text search engine which can help you query the database.  <br/><br/>
    </span>
    <span class="value">
      If, for example, you are interested in data that the Liu lab has published, simply type "Liu" (case sensitive) in the search box in any of the three views.  The search engine will return factors/cells/papers related to your search term.  <br/><br/>
    </span>
    <span class="value">
      The search engine was built with flexibility in mind, so "fuzzier" search terms like "development" and "embryo" will also work.  
    </span>
    <span class="value">
      To start a new search or to return to the original list of items, simply click on the "Clear Search" button.<br/><br/>
    </span>
    <span class="value">
      You may use boolean operators like AND and OR to build more complex search terms.  For example, if you are interested in searching for cell lines associated with the Liu lab and the factor FoxA1, you could try the following search term in the Cells View: Liu AND FOXA1.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="label">How to use CistromeMap: Jump to (Factor and Cells View only)</span>
    <span class="value">The "Jump to" links are navigational aids that help you filter the options in the Factors/Cells View items menu.  For example, to cull the factors that begin with the letter 'k' in the Factors View, you simply click the "K" in the Jump To list.
